# SnakeGame
I made this game for my school final assignment.

If you want to start this game you need to download eSnakeGame.java file and launch it with CMD.

CMD Launch:
1. I think you need to download java if you don't have it.
2. Open CMD and go to directory where eSnakeGame.java is downloaded. For example Desktop.
3. In CMD type "javac "
