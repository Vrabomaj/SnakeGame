# SnakeGame
I made this game for my school final assignment.

If you want to start this game you need to download eSnakeGame.java file and launch it with CMD.

CMD Launch:
1.  I think you need to download java if you don't have it.
2.  Open CMD and go to directory where eSnakeGame.java is downloaded. For example Desktop.
3.  In CMD type "javac SnakeGame.java" and hit enter.
4.  In CMD type "java SnakeGame" and game will start.

Game is not completely finished because I am lazy but it is playable.
